#### Projection modules
As supplied, OL3 supports the global EPSG:4326 (GPS-style latitude and longitude coordinates in degrees of angle) and EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator, as used by Google, OSM, Bing et al), and the conversion of coordinates between these two. Other projections are supported using [Proj4js](http://proj4js.org/). Each module in the projections registry defines the projection definition and exports the projection code so it can be imported by the appropriate source. OL's global-based implementation of Proj4js is not used. Instead each module calls addProjection() in common.js which imports Proj4js, adds the projection definition to it, and then adds the Proj4js transform functions to ol.proj. 

At present, the full build of Proj4js is used. When a new Proj4js version is to be used, the version no will have to be changed in common.js.
