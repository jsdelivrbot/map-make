<div>You can define this map by using the url querystring:
<br>after the '.html', add '?' followed by key=value pairs separated by '&amp;' as follows:
<br><i>either</i> one of the predefined mapDefs in the registry - mapDef=xxx - <i>or</i> one or more of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>rasters=xxx where 'xxx' is any of the raster servers supported; you can define several by separating them with a comma: rasters=xxx,yyy,zzz</li>
		<li>to centre the map at a given point: lat=nn&amp;lon=nn where 'nn' is any valid latitude and longitude number, such as '45.6789'; specify west and south values as negative numbers; note that one of these values without the other will be ignored; of course, if the map is for a specific country, the values should be within the area of that country, otherwise the map will get confused</li>
		<li>zoom=nn where 'nn' corresponds to the zoom level, from 0 (zoomed out); the number of zoom levels varies depending on the raster concerned, worldwide rasters may have 20 levels, country-specific ones much fewer</li>
	</ul>
	examples:
	<ul>
	<li>?mapDef=cataloniaVectors</li>
	<li>?rasters=catTopo&amp;lat=40&amp;lon=2&amp;zoom=4</li>
	</ul>
	by default, maps without vectors are zoomed out and centred on the mid-point of the area covered by the map; maps with vectors are zoomed to the extent of the vector data
